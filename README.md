# Python-GUI-Tryout

- As all the rest of the repositories, this needs a new Readme

- Needs the following libraries to work:
    - Tkinter comes as default with Python 3 but is considered to switch to PyQt5
    - Matplotlib will be used in some future release
    - Requests for HTTP requests 
    - Venv is used for the easier library management but is not mandatory
